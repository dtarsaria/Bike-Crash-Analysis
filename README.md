The goal of this analysis is to investigate into the bike incident dataset to find where/when the
incidents may have occurred. In addition, our main goal was to achieve traits for lethal and nonlethal accidents.
We came to the point where we realized both types of accidents were occurring
over the same traits. For instance, we figured out that both types of accidents were likely to occur
when there were clear cloud conditions with day-light and when helmet was not worn at the same
time. These problems were likely to happening at the intersection of roads and at the main lane of
roadway part where the speed limit was 35mph succeeded by 30 mph of speed limit/hour.
